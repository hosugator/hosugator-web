          Beyond being just an engineer, I strive to be a <span className="text-slate-900 font-medium">problem solver who understands business context</span>. 
          My experience coordinating tens of thousands of components and dozens of stakeholders in global EPC projects 
          has now become the foundation for designing complex cloud infrastructure and AI pipelines.

          I believe that technology proves its value not by itself, but when it creates business impact. 
          Every process of reducing latency and cutting costs must ultimately lead to customer success.
